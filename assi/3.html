    <h1><u> fist flight</u> </h1>
<p>The story of His First Flight is based on a young seagull who is afraid to fly because of distrust on its wings. All his younger siblings can fly fearlessly despite their shorter wings. On the other hand, the young bird cannot gather the courage to trust his wings. He always becomes afraid when coming forward to the brink of the ledge and attempting to fly. His mother and father come around calling him and threatening him starve on the ledge unless he flies. Despite all the upbraiding and calling to him shrilly, he could not move. All-day long he watches his parents fly with his siblings and teaching them how to skim the waves. this is writer by <u>Liam OH Hearty</u></p>
